# Versioning Policy

## Overview

**ts-graphviz** follows [**Semantic Versioning 2.0**](https://semver.org/) to ensure consistency and predictability. This policy clarifies how we manage breaking changes, especially those related to runtime support, and what users can expect when using **ts-graphviz**.

## Semantic Versioning

Version numbers are formatted as **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, with changes classified as follows:

- **MAJOR**: Introduces backward-incompatible changes.
- **MINOR**: Adds functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH**: Fixes bugs in a backward-compatible manner.

---

## Exceptions: TypeScript Version Updates

There are scenarios where **ts-graphviz** may deviate from strict Semantic Versioning:

- **TypeScript Definitions**: Breaking changes to TypeScript type definitions may occur between minor versions due to:
  - TypeScript introducing breaking changes in its own minor updates.
  - Adopting features available only in newer TypeScript versions, which may raise the minimum required TypeScript version.

:::tip
For TypeScript projects, we recommend pinning the **ts-graphviz** minor version to control upgrade timing and compatibility testing.

- **Documentation and Release Notes**: All changes to the versioning policy and support levels will be documented in our official documentation and detailed in release notes.
- **Community Engagement**: Users are encouraged to subscribe to updates or follow our repositories to stay informed about the latest developments.

## Migration Support

To assist users in transitioning between versions, especially when breaking changes occur:

- **Migration Guides**: We provide comprehensive migration guides outlining steps to upgrade to new major versions.
- **Code Examples**: Examples are included to demonstrate how to adapt code to accommodate changes.
- **Support Channels**: Users can seek assistance through community forums, issue trackers, or other support channels if they encounter difficulties during migration.
