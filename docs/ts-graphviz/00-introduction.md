# Introduction

## What is ts-graphviz?

**ts-graphviz** is a Graphviz library for TypeScript, allowing you to directly utilize the powerful features of [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/) within the TypeScript/JavaScript ecosystem. It fully integrates Graphviz's DOT language with TypeScript, enabling programmatic generation and manipulation of graphs. This makes it easy to visualize complex graphs and network structures based on dynamic data.
