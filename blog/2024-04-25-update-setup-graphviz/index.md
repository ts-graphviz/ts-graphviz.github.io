# Community Collaboration Drives ts-graphviz/setup-graphviz Evolution 🌟

Hello, ts-graphviz community!
We're excited to announce the latest releases of setup-graphviz, versions v2.0.1 and v2.0.2.

These updates were made possible through rapid community response to [issues related to GitHub Actions runner images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/9733).

### Release Highlights:

- **v2.0.1**: Fixed installation issues on Linux, enhancing stability. 🛠️
- **v2.0.2**: Removed scripts made redundant by updates to GitHub Actions environments. 🧹

We are deeply grateful for the dedicated efforts and support from developers, contributors, and users who came together to address these issues swiftly.
