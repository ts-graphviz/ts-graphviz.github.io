# Translated ts-graphviz Documentation into Chinese! 🌏

Hello, everyone!

We are thrilled to announce that we have successfully translated the ts-graphviz documentation into Chinese! 🚀

## Reason for Translation 📈

Based on our analysis with Google Analytics, we found that the highest number of accesses, outside of the United States and Japan (Yuki, the author of ts-graphviz's home country), were from China. In response to this data, we decided to translate the documentation into Chinese to allow the developer community in China to utilize ts-graphviz more widely.

## Translation Process and Collaboration 🤝

The translation work was carried out with the assistance of Hao, our trusted collaborator. Hao's extensive experience in translation and technical knowledge greatly facilitated the smooth progress of this project. With his help, we were able to provide the ease of use and comprehensibility of ts-graphviz to Chinese-speaking users.

## Hoping for Increased Usage of ts-graphviz in China 🌟

ts-graphviz is a powerful tool that easily integrates graph visualization into TypeScript projects. We hope that this tool will be widely used within the Chinese developer community, making project visualization even more efficient. We expect the translated documentation to be a valuable resource for many users, overcoming language barriers.

## Future Outlook 🚀

We will continue to make further improvements and provide support to ensure that ts-graphviz becomes an indispensable tool for developers worldwide, including in China. We welcome feedback and contributions from the community, so please feel free to share your thoughts and suggestions.

Please check out the new Chinese documentation and experience the convenience of ts-graphviz!

Thank you very much!

The ts-graphviz Team ❤️
